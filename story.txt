The Lazy Dog Dilemma
by Ben Radosevich, Sarah Fahlberg, and Alex Wu

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. "Why'd you jump over me?" said the lazy dog. "Well, thats just what quick brown foxes do! Especially
when there are lazy dogs laying around." replied the quick brown fox. 

The quick brown fox blazed by, and kept running. Then, he came by a cardinal, who said, "Catch if you can!" The cocky quick brown fox said, "I got you sis! Say less!" He ran and ran, but couldn't catch Ms. Cardinal.
